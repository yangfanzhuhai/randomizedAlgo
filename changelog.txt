if (t == NULL || *newNode < *target) {

should be

if (t == NULL || *newNode < *t) {


This is because we are inserting the new node after
target and in front of t. Therefore we should check that 
newnode is bigger than target and smaller than t.


Question:
When will add() return 0?
Need to double check when return 0 and when to return 1 for add()
